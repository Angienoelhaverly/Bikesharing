# Bikesharing
## Project Overview
Tableau is a powerful data analytical tool that provides easy to understand dashboards for non-technical and technical viewers alike. Tableau visualizations provide analysts a way to tell a clear story and easily share that story with others. 

This project will use a dataset on cityBike in New York City that will help create a business proposal for a potential bike sharing company.
